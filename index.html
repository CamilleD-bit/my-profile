        <h2>Music </h2>
        <p align="justify">
          Music has always something i adored even as a kid. My mom told me that even before I learned how to talk I was already singing some type of melody. And I did some singing constests and I might consider being a profesional singer if I ever get the Chance. Music is also something that makes me relieve from my stress and is a really important part of my life.

        <h2>Travels </h2>
        <p>
          My parents love to travel, so I've always been used to travel a lot and all around the world. I've actaully been to every continent. The latest country I visited was Thailand(Phuket) last summer. Indeed one the prettiest country of the world and also with the nicest people. All of my travels taught me a lot of different culture that I love and thanks to it I can consider myself proudly as a multicultural individual.
